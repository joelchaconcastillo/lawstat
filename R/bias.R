#' Prediction Errors ("Biases") of Surface Temperature Forecasts
#' 
#' Prediction errors of 48-hour ahead MM5 forecasts of surface temperature measured 
#' at 96 locations in the US Pacific Northwest on 3-January-2000. The prediction error, 
#' or "bias", is the difference between the forecasted and observed surface
#' temperature. (MM5 is the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University -- 
#' National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model.)
